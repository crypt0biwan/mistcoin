# MistCoin reverse engineering

Purpose of this repo is to get the Solidity source code of the very first ERC-20 token called MistCoin (MC) which was created on November 3rd, 2015

## Learnings so far
* Compiler has to be Solidity <= 0.1.6 since the contract was deployed on November 3rd, 2015 and version 0.1.7 was release on November 17 2015. See [Solidity version history](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases?page=10)
* In [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3rcnrx/ethereum_wallet_beta3_contract_deployment_and/) which was exactly on the same date as the deployment of MistCoin Fabian included a link of the Mist wallet (version 0.3.5) and [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/0.3.5) on how to deploy a token.
* [The token example](http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/?gist=909d02feff3a2e59f714#gist=909d02feff3a2e59f714) which was used does contain all the methods of the MistCoin token. This example is included in the repo at `contracts/MyToken.sol`. However it doesn't compile to the bytecode of the MistCoin contract
* [The sol contract](https://gist.github.com/frozeman/20c8b5658349b003b08d) is in this public gist

## Notes

* [MistCoin token on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf4eced2f682ce333f96f2d8966c613ded8fc95dd)
* You can use [this webpage](https://piyolab.github.io/playground/ethereum/getEncodedFunctionSignature/) to see the bytecode of a function. for example putting in `name()` converts to `06fdde03` (remove the `0x` part)

## Bytecode

## Functions in the bytecode

```
06fdde03 -> name()
313ce567 -> decimals()
70a08231 -> balanceOf(address)
95d89b41 -> symbol()
a9059cbb -> transfer(address,uint256)
```

## Compile

* Make sure you have nodejs installed
* Make sure the `solc` dependency is installed (npm i)
* Run `node deploy.js` to compile the contract `contracs/MyToken.sol`

When successful you will see this text in the console:
